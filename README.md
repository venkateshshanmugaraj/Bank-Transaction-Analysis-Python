# Bank-Transaction-Analysis-Python
This project analyzes bank transaction data using Python. I cleaned the dataset, checked balance status, flagged high-value transactions, and identified spending patterns. The goal was to turn raw financial data into clear insights that support better tracking and decision-making.
